# House Price Prediction Project
Description:
Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository! This project is aimed at predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. Whether you're a real estate enthusiast, a data scientist, or simply curious about predictive modeling, this repository provides a comprehensive solution.
Key Features:
Datasets: We've curated a diverse collection of housing datasets from different regions, ensuring the model's versatility and accuracy.
Jupyter Notebooks: Explore our Jupyter notebooks containing detailed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development steps.
Machine Learning Models: We've implemented and fine-tuned a variety of regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to provide accurate price predictions.
Evaluation Metrics: Learn about the evaluation metrics we've used to quantify model performance and understand their significance in the context of housing price prediction.
Interactive Visualization: Dive into interactive visualizations that offer insights into the relationships between different features and housing prices.
Contributor-Friendly: We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just starting, your insights and code improvements are invaluable to us.
